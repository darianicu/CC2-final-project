# Submitting your project

To get started:

1. Create a Github account
2. Download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Read [this guide](https://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2020/08/09/student-project-repository) and keep the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) close at hand.

The submission process is as follows (adapted from [here](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/deliverables/05-major-project/#submission-process)):

1. *fork* this template to your own Github account

_(if for some reason you'd prefer to keep your repo hidden from the public, you can set it as Private from Settings - "Change visibility". You then need to add me as a collaborator, so I can have access.)_

2. *clone* the repo in your Github Desktop, to download it locally

3. *commit* and *push* as you work on your project. The last version pushed to the server before the deadline will count in the evaluation.

## Necessary elements

1. This readme, filled in. Title, description, usage instructions, useful links. 

    You may include images and even [animated gifs](https://www.screentogif.com/), or links to audio/video materials.

2. Filled-in [statement of originality](statement-of-originality.yml). Anything not in it will count as 100% your own contribution.

    *(the format is adapted from [here](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1720/2018/comp1720-2018-major-project/-/blob/master/statement-of-originality.yml). I'm aware of the irony of using a document taken from [somewhere else](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1720/resources/faq/#how-do-i-fill-out-my-statement-of-originality), but it's not plagiarism as long as we mention the source!)*

3. The project itself. Include all the code necessary in order to be able to run the project as per the readme instructions. If large assets are needed, [use Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) or include download links in your install instructions.
